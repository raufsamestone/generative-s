This is a web app that generates sound and art based on user input. The app uses the React framework for the user interface, Tone.js for generating sound, and P5.js for generating art.

## Installation

Clone the repository: 

`git clone https://github.com/raufsamestone/generative-s.git`

Install dependencies and start. 
`yarn && yarn dev`

## Usage

The app displays a canvas and a button. The canvas generates random text based on user input. The button plays a sound, and the pitch of the sound changes based on the user's mouse movement.

## User Input

The user can change the canvas width and height using the range inputs. The canvas will update automatically as the user changes the values.


##Sound

The app generates a sine wave sound using Tone.js. The pitch of the sound is determined by the user's mouse movement. Moving the mouse to the right increases the pitch, while moving it to the left decreases the pitch.

## Art

The canvas generates random text in different colors and sizes based on the user's input.
